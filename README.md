# Filename Playlist Maker
Edit your playlists by adding prefixes to filenames so that the songs appear in your desired order when sorted alphabetically. Supports all types of files.

## Editing modes
- ### New Playlist (create new folder with copies of files)
Select files and save to a new folder when finished editing.
- ### New Playlist (work on existing folder)
Select a folder to work on. Not recommended as you won't be able to recover deleted files and original files will be renamed.
- ### Edit Existing Playlist
Select a folder previously created with this app. Detects prefixes after loading filenames and ignores them. To add more songs to a playlist, simply copy them into the folder and edit it in this mode. New files will get indexed and prefixes will be added after saving changes.
